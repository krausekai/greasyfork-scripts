<b>Changes from looki's script</b> (v1.4.0)
<b>Added:</b>
* Now displays Kana from Wanikani when you hover your cursor over a replaced word (along with it's English meaning).
* Inclusion list: You can now include your own meanings, kana and kanji as a custom list - add conjugations and translations WaniKani doesn't!
* Exclusion list: You can now exclude specific meanings from WaniKani, so those meanings won't be vocabularized on websites.
* Choice of menu: Prior to v1.4 of looki's script, you were able to use a right-click context menu (may be Firefox only). In v1.4 he removed this, opting only for the GreaseMonkey menu. Now you have both.
<b>Removed:</b>
* Auto-updater. It only refreshed vocabulary when a week passed. Also limited manual refreshing between a lesser time frame.
<b>Fixed:</b>
* Kanji is now in a readable font: Arial. Will no longer use the site's font you're on.
* It appeared that conjugations such as "es, ed, ing" were not being applied. They should be now.
<b>Improved:</b>
* Streamlined menu button commands. For example "Toggle auto-run" is actually a toggle, with no need for a prompt.
* [Developer] Replaced "for...in" loops with basic for-loops, which should technically yield better performance across the board.
* [Developer] Refactored code all around. Many redundant conditions, variables and checks have been removed; such as hash.code checking.
