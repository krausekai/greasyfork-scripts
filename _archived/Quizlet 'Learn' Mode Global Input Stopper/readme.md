<b>2018 NOTICE: THIS SCRIPT IS NO LONGER COMPATIBLE WITH QUIZLET</b>

When answering questions on Quizlet's 'Write' screen, this script will block the screen from continuing to the next question due to (accidental) clicks and button presses.

Additionally, with this script, it is now possible to control this screen with only the keyboard:
Enter: Submit answer.
Space: Override answer.
